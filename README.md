## Welcome to My GitHub Pages

Use the following [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/github-Charlie/myworld/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for the website in Markdown files.

Whenever a commit is made to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in the site, from the content of the Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling the writing. It includes conventions for general HTML-like codes.
For more details, just visit [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

The Github Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme that I have selected in the [repository settings](https://github.com/github-Charlie/myworld/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
